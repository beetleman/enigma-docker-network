Enigma Docker Network
=====================

The Enigma Docker Network is the first release of the Enigma Protocol in a 
containerized environment that offers a complete minimum viable test network 
(testnet). This release is aimed at developers to familiarize themselves with 
the unique and powerful features that the Enigma Protocol offers, and to 
provide a sandbox to start writing `secret contracts`.
